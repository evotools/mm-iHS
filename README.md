# mm-iHS
This repository contains Perl scripts for calculating mm-iHS. getEHH.pl being run first to calculate EHH decay around pairs of variants, and calculate_mmiHS.pl being run across the output from the first script to generate normalised mm-iHS values.

For more details on each script run them with the -man option e.g.:

```perl
perl getEHH.pl -man
```
